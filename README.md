# Algorithm Highest / Max Product

Algorithm that returns the highest product between three numbers of a given array of integers. 

I have developed two approaches which take time and space complexity into account.

## Approach 1

- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)


## Approach 2

- Time Complexity: O(n + k)
- Space Complexity: O(k)
